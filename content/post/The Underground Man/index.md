## Introduction

For a long time I have been debating how I should structure this post or whether I should write it at all. However, I knew immediately after my first reading of Dostoevsky's *Notes from Underground* that I had to share this book with as many people as possible. I felt as if it was my moral duty to do so. One thing I know for sure is that, for me, I cannot understand something truly unless I write about it. I have since read this novel another two times and the longer I put off writing about it the clearer it has become that I **must** write about it. Having said that, I feel that a lengthy, broad discussion of the novel would fail to do it justice. Rather, what I have included in this post is a short synopsis of the novel and some personal thoughts on what I consider to be one of the most profound monologues from the titular character - the Underground Man. 

I hope that what I have to say is sufficient to convince you to read it for yourself. It is about 150 pages long, yet it is the most psychologically rich text I have ever encountered. Of course, I also recommend watching [Max Derrat's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXsC_OWiT_U) and [Jordan Peterson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qZ3EsrKPsc) video's on the novel, which have greatly influenced my ideas in this post.

## Synopsis

*Notes from Underground* is written from the perspective of the Underground Man, an anonymous, middle-aged bureaucrat living in St. Petersburg, Russia in the 1860s. We meet him just as he receives a small inheritance and retires from his civil service job. The Underground Man struggles with his own extreme cynicism, nihilism and alienation from society. The novel is essentially a collection of memoirs in which he confesses and explains his antagonistic position toward society. He describes himself as "too conscious", so aware of his own thoughts, feelings and vulnerabilities that he is cripplingly self-critical and completely incapable of meaningful action. He is hyper-intelligent and educated, which makes him bitter and resentful about his lack of status and success. Consequently, he retreats into a life "underground", a metaphor for the fringes of society from which he relentlessly criticises everybody he has ever encountered. 

The Underground Man is utterly miserable and truly believes that everyone deserves to wallow in the same misery. He certainly acts in accordance with this belief, as evidenced by his awkward and hostile interactions with everyone he meets. Yet as miserable and cynical as he is, the Underground Man is aware of the pathology he inhabits and is ashamed of himself. What you see as you read his "notes" from the underground, or *feel* rather, is the very worst of yourself - the part of you that is cynical, resentful, lazy, arrogant and deceitful. 

Margaret Atwood once said that the goal of the writer is to keep the reader believing in your story despite knowing it is fictional. The Underground Man is a character that is so terrifyingly relatable, intelligent and articulate, that most readers will have to remind themselves that they are in fact reading a fictional story and are not peering into the darkest corners of their own unconscious mind.

## Rationality, Free-will and Utopianism

Not forty pages into the novel, the Underground Man delivers one of the greatest and most eloquent philosophical critiques I have ever encountered. Essentially, he argues against rational egoism, the notion that life could be perfected solely through the application of reason and enlightened self-interest. In doing so, he postulates that humans are not entirely rational beings and thus will never be capable of achieving a state of utopia like the ones so commonly envisioned by modern ideologues. I will go through the chapter, if not for your digestion, then at least for my own understanding. The Underground Man begins:

> "In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can't say is that it's rational. The very word sticks in one's throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one."

Lots of things act according to rational principles. All of scientific theory pretty much exclusively relies on principles of rationality. A student of science is one who attempts to master such principles in order to accurately explain the world and reliably predict the future. But any student of history, of human beings, will know that rationality cannot explain the absolute catastrophe that is human history. There are elements to history that are so grotesque and disturbing that they cannot be explained, nor were predicted, at least to the degree that they relate to people acting out of pure rationality and self-interest. 

"So what?" many would say. It can be argued that as a species, humans have yet to master rationality, which implies that one day we will in fact do so. Psychologists in particular, who sit at the intersection between empiricism and the study of human nature, have done well to outline many of the ways in which humans can fall into traps of irrationality (e.g. the numerous heuristics and biases popularised by Tversky and Kahneman) and in turn have taught us how to act as more rational agents. But the Underground Man argues that people are far more complicated than rationale beings subject to thinking biases. I will let him speak for himself.

> "Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary--that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar." 

One of the most remarkable statements I have ever come across. It begs the question "If you had everything you wanted, if all of your biological needs were fulfilled, would you be satisfied?". The Underground Man argues you would not. But most people know this already. Money, security and material possessions can only get you so far. Maslow's Hierarchy echo's a similar sentiment, emphasising the importance of prestige, feelings of accomplishment, creative activities and, ultimately, achieving one's full potential. But the Underground Man goes a step further, suggesting that even if we had everything we wanted, we would not only be dissatisfied, but purposefully make things *worse* just so something interesting would happen. What if being dissatisfied, working towards something, is part of what really satisfies us? 

> "And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! 

> I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know?"

> You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.

> Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!"

What if the very chaos, uncertainty, vulnerability, pain and fear that comes with being human (and irrational) is what we *need*, or even what we *want*? Maybe our irrationality and inescapable desire to prove control over our own lives is exactly what is special about human beings in the first place. Unlike what the proponents of utopian ideals believe, we can never completely succumb to the laws of rationality. Unfortunately, that means we might never achieve the utopia we all think we want. But at least we can be sure we are not piano keys. 

Even the ancient Sumerians seemed to understand something of this sort 4000 years ago. In the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, one of the oldest surviving epic poems, the hero searches for immortality, but upon meeting a fellow human already endowed with such a blessing, is quickly convinced that a life without limitation, without vulnerability, is a life not worth living. The very first thing you realise when you have infinite time at your disposal, is that nothing is worth doing, because it can always be done later. And so a being unbound by limitation is incapable of meaningful action. 

And so we cannot be considered entirely rational agents, nor ever hope to become so. We are destined to suffer at the hands of our own irrationality, regardless of how far we advance technology and master the physical world. But that is not something over which we should despair. It is this very limitation, along with all the others we inhabit, that makes our lives meaningful in the first place. This can be a depressing revelation, existentially catastrophic even. It is the sort of revelation that can produce the pathology of the Underground Man. But if accepted with dignity and courage, this truth can guide you towards a meaningful life. Even the Underground Man understood this. I will leave you to ponder one of his final questions to the reader:

> "Which is better - a cheap happiness or lofty suffering? Tell me then, which is better?"
