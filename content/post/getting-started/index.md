## A little about me...

Hi! My name is Luke. I am currently a student at the University of New South Wales in my 3rd year of the Bachelor of Psychology program. This year (2021), despite the pandemic nightmare, I have been fortunate enough to work as a research assistant for the [Grisham OCD Lab](http://www.grishamocdlab.com/), headed by Professor Jessica Grisham. Over the last 6 months, I have been collaborating with a PhD student on a systematic review concerning the role of imagery in the treatment of worry. For this particular project, I am working as a second blind reviewer, tasked with reading and evaluating over 180 scientific papers for potential inclusion in the review.

When I'm not doing lab or course work, I like to grab a beer with mates, read a good book or watch a classic movie, like The Great Escape (hence the picture of the Cooler King above!). I am also the biggest Pittsburgh Steeler fan this side of the Pacific. As a lover of the Australian psych-rock scene, you can usually find me listening to some King Gizzard or Tame Impala, if I'm not jamming along on the drums. 

I decided to make this website as a space for friends, colleagues, future employers etc. to keep up with my academic and career activities. For those who don't know, next year I will be completing my Honours and, beyond that, I hope to complete either a Master's degree in clinical psychology or a PhD (or both). This site will be the optimal spot for me to post updates on all of my research activities. For now, however, I intend to test it out with some small updates regarding my academic or personal projects. In the next section, I will give a little detail to how I put the site together. If you just came here to learn a little about me and don't care about website building at all, this is probably where you should stop. Thanks for dropping by!

## How This Site Was Built

This site was built off an academic template from Hugo and published through Wowchemy and Netlify. All of the code for this site was written using R. If you are proficient in R and would like to build a personal, academic site like this one, I highly recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox_Ue9yzf-0&list=LL&index=8&t=135s) by fellow Aussie Daniel Quintana which talks about how to make this site using **blogdown** for R. Beyond this fantastic introductory tutorial, the rest of the site building procedure is well explained by [Wochemy](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/). Of course, I also have to give credit to [UNSW CodeRs](https://unsw-coders.netlify.app/) for providing useful website building tips, and a past tutor [Jenny Sloane](https://jennysloane.netlify.app/#about) (who also has a great tutorial on her website about using **blogdown**), for the original idea and inspiration.
